<p>Through making this game, we were able to create an
immersive gameplay experience with 3D audio. We utilized
various characteristics like the perception of sound and
localization and tested it with various subjects to determine
the effectiveness of this game and, as the experiment went
on, we could confirm that the test subjects had a clearer 3D
audio experience with the game overall. We strive to have
more functionality and a more immersive experience if
worked on in the future as well as having it usable on
multiple consoles and systems.</p>
